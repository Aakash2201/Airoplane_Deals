# Airplane_Deals
This is one of my simple showcase websites, where through small and basic projects I highlight the skills I've utilized while working at my company on multiple projects. Specifically, this project demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing flight information APIs to find the best and cheapest round-trip deals for the current month.
